## Create new Study


To create tasks and studies use MDX/Markdown. On the instructions Page the syntax is extendend by $$$. By seperating your instruction set by these $$$ you seperate the resuting component in widgets. This might be useful to better explain the user certain features as well as keep the user from skipping the entire Instruction page.

To insert images, upload them on supabase storage and copy the image url in the markdown entry accordingly.
